# TimeSeries_Project2324

This repository houses a project utilizing the CRISP-DM methodology to forecast sales for a multinational industrial company. The initiative involved meticulous data exploration, extensive industry research, and in-depth analysis using macroeconomic indicators. The preprocessing phase included adjustments for inflation, data aggregation, and stationarity analysis, followed by feature engineering to capture time dependencies. Models such as XGBoost, Prophet, and TimeGPT were trained on three different datasets, each tailored with specific features to optimize prediction accuracy. The final evaluation compared RMSE across these models to select the best for future sales forecasting, with a primary focus on minimizing RMSE.
