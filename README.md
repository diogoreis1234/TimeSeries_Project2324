# TimeSeries_Project2324

This repository houses a project utilizing the CRISP-DM methodology to forecast sales for a multinational industrial company. The initiative involved meticulous data exploration, extensive industry research, and in-depth analysis using macroeconomic indicators. The preprocessing phase included adjustments for inflation, data aggregation, and stationarity analysis, followed by feature engineering to capture time dependencies. Models such as XGBoost, Prophet, and TimeGPT were trained on three distinct datasets for each product group: the original dataset, an enhanced dataset with lagged features, and a refined dataset that incorporates outlier adjustments, all meticulously crafted to optimize prediction accuracy. The final evaluation involved a comparison of RMSE across these models, strategically focusing on minimizing RMSE to select the most effective model for future sales forecasting.
