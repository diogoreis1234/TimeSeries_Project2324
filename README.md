# TimeSeries_Project2324

This repository houses a project utilizing the CRISP-DM methodology to forecast sales for a multinational industrial company. The initiative involved meticulous data exploration, extensive industry research, and in-depth analysis using macroeconomic indicators. The preprocessing phase included adjustments for inflation, data aggregation, and stationarity analysis, followed by feature engineering to capture time dependencies. Models were trained on three different datasets, each tailored with specific features to optimize prediction accuracy. The final phase involved comparing RMSE across models to select the best for future sales forecasting.

## Business Needs and Required Outcome
### Business Background
The company operates in three business branches: Industrial Business, Services, and Other Business. The Smart Infrastructure Division, part of the Industrial Business, produces smart power distribution components, necessitating accurate sales forecasting.

### Business Objectives
The goal is to develop an AI-driven model to forecast sales, enhance inventory management, and optimize production plans. This helps in mitigating risks associated with economic fluctuations and optimizes marketing efforts.

### Business Success Criteria
Success is measured by the accurate forecast of monthly sales for selected product groups, enabling improved operational efficiency and decision-making.

### Situation Assessment
The availability of historical sales data and macroeconomic indicators, combined with robust technological infrastructure, supports advanced predictive modeling.

### Data Mining Goals
The project leverages sales data from October 2018 to April 2022 and key economic indicators to predict sales for May 2022 to February 2023. The primary metric for model performance is the minimization of RMSE.
